# Boxel

## Description
Boxel is a 2D side scrolling action game.  The name of the game is to
defeat as many greenie meanies as possible using your trusty laser rifle
and modular replicator.  Objects in Boxel each have special modules, which
can be acquired or swapped using the modular replicator.  Players can
employ clever tactics by combining various modules or even altering the
modules of their enemies in order to defeat them.  This high-action,
high-octane thrill ride of a game will have you clinging to your seat as
you wipe out round after round of greanie meanies!  Will you survive?
