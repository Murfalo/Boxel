Tileset Reference:

Every two rows = 1 tileset. 
They are designed to be thematically similar to one another.
Of course, there is nothing preventing you from throwing together multiple
tilesets together in the same room if you feel like it makes the world look better.

I will always put the tiles in the tileset in the following format:

Row 1:
-1: block: Intended to build walls with.
-2: Steep Slope: Intended to be thematically similar to siding blocks.
-3: Vertical Border: Surround solid areas with this siding to make the
edges look more apparent. Place on top of the solid blocks in a different layer.
-4: Solid block: Use for solid objects.
-5: Solid slope: Another slope, intended to be thematically similar to # 4
-6: Background: Place on background layer
-7: Background Vertical: use for "pillars" in the background
-8: Background horizontal: typically placed under ceiling or along the ground.

Row 2:
-1: Slope bottom: Thematically similar to siding. bottom of slope
-2: Slope top: Thematically similar to siding. top of slope
-3: Outer Corner Border: Surround solid areas with this siding to make the edges look more apparent. Place on top of the solid blocks in a different layer.
-4: Horizontal Border:
-5: Inner Corner Border: 
-6: Jump through platform: Thin platform the character can jump through.
-7: Jump through platform 2: Alternate form of jump through platform.
-8: Foreground Fence: Place on a separate layer. Will appear in front of player.
